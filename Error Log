I encountered a lot of error along the way.
1. I did not know how to join 2 table with exact column names => Find out about UNION/UNION ALL
2. I did not know about select all => asterisk (*)
3. Table is created => DROP TABLE IF EXISTS with an S
4. Incompatible types in tables => I tried the CAST function, did not work => I will look at the uploads again
=> Found the root cause: I deleted the format of some of the files, hence the data is converted from type TIMESTAMP to type FLOAT
5. Table too big => changed to new file format, didnt work => split files in half
6. Relearn how to use DISTINCT, COUNT, and GROUP BY, and HAVING
